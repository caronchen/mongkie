name=Force Directed (Spring)
description=Layout that positions graph elements based on a physics simulation of interacting forces. By default, nodes repel each other, edges act as springs, and drag forces (similar to air resistance) are applied. The running time of this layout algorithm is the greater of O(N log N) and O(E), where N is the number of nodes and E the number of edges.
ForceDirected.nbodyForce.gravitationalConstant.name=Gravitational Constant
ForceDirected.nbodyForce.gravitationalConstant.description=The gravitational constant to use. Nodes will attract each other if this value is positive, and will repel each other if it is negative.
ForceDirected.nbodyForce.distance.name=Distance
ForceDirected.nbodyForce.distance.description=The distance within which two particles will interact. If -1, the value is treated as infinite.
ForceDirected.nbodyForce.theta.name=Barnes-Hut Theta
ForceDirected.nbodyForce.theta.description=The Barnes-Hut parameter theta, which controls when an aggregated mass is used rather than drilling down to individual item mass values.
ForceDirected.dragForce.dragCoefficient.name=Drag Coefficient
ForceDirected.dragForce.dragCoefficient.description=The drag co-efficient to help stabilize items.
ForceDirected.springForce.springCoefficient.name=Spring Coefficient
ForceDirected.springForce.springCoefficient.description=The default spring co-efficient to use.
ForceDirected.springForce.springLength.name=Spring Length
ForceDirected.springForce.springLength.description=The default spring length to use.
