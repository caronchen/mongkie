name=Fruchterman-Reingold
description=Layout implementing the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm for force-directed placement of graph nodes. The computational complexity of this algorithm is quadratic O(n^2) in the number of nodes, so should only be applied for relatively small graphs, particularly in interactive situations.
