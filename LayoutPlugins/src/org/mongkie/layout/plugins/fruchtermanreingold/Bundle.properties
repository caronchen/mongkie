name=Fruchterman-Reingold
description=Layout implementing the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm for force-directed placement of graph nodes. Fruchterman-Reingold is a classical layout algorithm, since 1984.
#description=Layout implementing the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm for force-directed placement of graph nodes. The computational complexity of this algorithm is quadratic O(n^2) in the number of nodes, so should only be applied for relatively small graphs, particularly in interactive situations.

param.area.name = Area
param.area.description = The graph size area, for example 1000 for 100 nodes.

param.gravity.name = Gravity
param.gravity.description = This force attracts all nodes to the center to avoid dispersion of disconnected components.

param.speed.name = Speed
param.speed.description = Value > 0 default 1 ; increase convergence speed at the price of a precision loss.
