name=Radial Tree
description=Tree layout that computes a radial layout, laying out subsequent\
 depth levels of a tree on circles of progressively increasing radius.\
 The algorithm used is that of Ka-Ping Yee, Danyel Fisher, Rachna Dhamija, and Marti Hearst in their research paper\
 Animated Exploration of Dynamic Graphs with Radial Layout, InfoVis 2001.\
 This algorithm computes a radial layout which factors in possible variation in sizes,\
 and maintains both orientation and ordering constraints to facilitate smooth and understandable transitions between layout configurations.
