![Mongkie](http://mongkie.org/images/ismb2012-sig-abstract.png)

MONGKIE is an integrated network visualization and analysis platform which allows us to explore and analyze inter-connected biological data in an interactive manner with knowledge integration environment. It is designed for both the visualization of biological networks and the analysis of these networks with a seamless integration between the two procedures. MONGKIE incorporates knowledge integration and network analysis modules into the visualization platform, such as Import and Export, Interaction Manager, Gene ID Conversion, Expression Overlay, Network Clustering, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis(GO and Pathway), Pathway Integration and Visualization.
